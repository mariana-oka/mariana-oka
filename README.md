### Hey there!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a design technologist with a love for front end and 10 years of product design experience under my belt. I'm always looking for new and creative ways to solve problems. In my spare time, you can find me building creative projects, playing board games or checking out immersive art exhibits. Just a warning, I have been known to sneak a few emoji into my commit messages. ðŸ˜‰ I speak HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. Thanks for stopping by!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a DeSci platform
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently reading On the Edge
- âš¡ Fun fact I am interested in generative art, longevity and existential hope.
