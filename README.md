👩🏻‍💻 Hey there! I'm a front-end developer with a twist - I've got 10 years of product design experience under my belt. I bring a unique perspective to the table, and I'm always looking for new and creative ways to solve problems. In my spare time, you can find me binge-watching sci-fi movies or checking out immersive exhibits in town. Just a warning, I have been known to sneak a few emoji into my commit messages. 😉 I speak HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. Thanks for stopping by!
